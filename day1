JDK, JRE and JVM

JDK - Java Development Kit
    It contains tools such as compilers to develop the Java programs
    A compiler converts the Java code into bytecode
    javac - compile the java code
        -- byte code
JVM - Java Virtual Machine
    java - run the byte code
    It is a virtual machine that runs the Java bytecodes.
JRE - Java Runtime Environment
    It contains JVM, Class libraries and other supporting files.
variable
    A variable is used to store some value.

    int a
Data type

    0.1f == 0.1 false

    0.1f is actually 0.1000000000

    0.1 is actually 0.10000000000000000000000005585373673636378378

    int num = 21;

    int - data type

    num - variable
    
    21 - Literal

    Literals
        Integer
             
            Decimal Integer - Digits from 0 to 9 (+ and -)

            Octal Integer - Digits from 0 to 7 with a leading 0

            Hexa-Decimal - started by 0x and may also include a character from a to f or A to F (it reprents numbers from 10 to 15)

            Binary Integer - Base 2, whose digits consists of the numbers 0 and 1.
            prefix 0b represnts the binary system


        Character

Operators
    Arithematic Operators -- arithmetic operation
    + - * / %
    Relational Operators --checks the relationship  between two operands
    ==
    !=
    >
    <
    >=
    <=

    Logical Operators - checks if the expressions is true or false
    AND && -- true (if both the expression are true)
    OR || -- false(if both the expression are false)
    ! -- It is used to reverse a condition
    
    Assignment Operators
    = += -= *= /= %=

    Increment and Decrement Operators
    ++ --
    it always increases/ decreases the value by 1

    a++
    ++a

    --a

    write a program to calculate the sum of the first and the second last digit of a 5 digit number.

    ex - 12345
    output - 1+4 =5

    write a program to add 8 to the number 2345 and then divide it by 3. Now , the modulus of the qoutient is taken with 5 and then multiply the resultant value by 5. Display the result.

    John has come to Mathew store to purchase some products
    product         quantity
    ItemA           2
    ItemB           1
    ItemC           3

    cost of the products
    product         Cost
    ItemA           200
    ItemB           75
    ItemC           500

    At the time John visisted the store, there was 10% discount on all product.
    Finally a service tax of 5% is applicable on all products
    calculate the amount John has to pay?

    price = ((ItemA*2)+(ItemB)+(ItemC*3))
    price = price - (.1*price)
    price = price + (.05*price)

    1866.375
