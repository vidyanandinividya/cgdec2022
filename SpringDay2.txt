JSP, Servlet and MVC Design Pattern
Java Annotaions
    These are simply special labels or markers that are added to Java classes,
    they actually give you the meta-data about the class.
It basically allows you to minimize XML xonfiguration.

Enable component scannong in spring config file
Add the @Component annotation to your Java classes
Retrieve the bean from Spring container

Spring AutoWiring
    for dependency injection, spring can use auto AutoWiring
    Spring will look for a class that matches the property
        matches by type : class or interface
    spring will inject it automatically

    Define the dependency interface and class
    Create a constructor in your class for injections
    Configure the dependency injection with @Autowired annotation

    Create setter methods in your class for injections
    configure the dependency injection with @Autowired Annotation

    Field/Method injection
        Configure the dependency injection with Autowired annotation
            apply directly to the Field
            No need of setter methods.
Bean Scope
    @Scope - Singleton or Proptotype
Bean Lifecycle methods
    @PostConstruct
    @PreDestroy

There are three ways of configuring the Spring container
    full xml config where you list each bean in the xml file
    xml component scan, and we made use of annotations 
    java configuration class

Define method to expose bean
Inject bean dependencies
Read Spring Java Configuration class
Retrieve bean from Spring conatiner

Spring Boot
    it is a module in Spring Framework
Lombok
    Project Lombok is a java library tool that generates code for minimizing boilerplate code.
    The library replaces the boilerplate code with annotations
