Database
    It is an organized collection of structured information or data.
    A database is controlled by Database Management System (DBMS)

Types of Database
    Relational Database
        It is the most efficient way to access structured information.
        The data is organized into a set of tables that has columns and rows.
            MySql - Apache 
            PostgreSQL - worldwide team of volunteers
                It is an open-source database
            Oracle - Oracle
            Microsoft SQL server - Microsoft 
            IBM Db2 - IBM 
    Distributed Database
    Object-oriented Database
    Open-source Database
    Centralized Database
    Cloud Database
    NoSQL Database
            MongoDB
    Hierachial Database
    Network Database

DDL (Data Definition Language)
    These commands  are used to define the database
        CREATE, DROP, ALTER, TRUNCATE, COMMENT, RENAME
    CREATE  
        It is used to either create a schema, tables or an index
    
    CREATE TABLE table_name(column1 datatype,column2 datatype(max_size),......);

    ALTER
        It is used to either add,modify or delete constraints and columns from a table
    DROP
        It is used to drop the complete schema ,table or columns
    TRUNCATE
        It is used to delete the data which is present inside a table, but the table doesn't get deleted
    RENAME
        It is used to rename one or more tables or columns
Types of keys
    Candiadte key
        A candidate key is a combination of minimal sety of attributes which can uniquely identify a tuple.
    Super key
        A super key is the set of attributes which can uniquely identify a tuple.
        a candiadte key is a super key but vice-versa isn't true
    Primary key
        A primary key is a set of attributes that can be used to uniquely identify every tuple.
    Alternate key
        All the candidate keys other than the primary key is called as an alternate key
    Foreign key
        An attribute that can take the values present as the values of some other attribute, is the foreign key to the attribute to which it refers.
constraints 
    NOT NULL
        It ensures that a NULL value cannot be stored in a column
    UNIQUE 
        It ensures that all the values in a column are different
    PRIMARY KEY = NOT NULL + UNIQUE 
    CHECK
        It ensures that all the values in a column satisfy a specific condition
    DEFAULT
        It consists of  a set of default values for a column when no value is specified
    INDEX 
        It is used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly
    FOREIGN KEY = Parent Table (Primary key ) --> Child Table (Foreign Key)

DML (Data Manipulation Language)
    These commands deal with the manipulation of data present in the database
        SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SET SEARCH_PATH
    SET SEARCH_PATH
        It is used to mention which schema has to be used to perform all the operations.
    INSERT
        It is used to insert new records in a table
    UPDATE
        It is used to modify the existing records in a table.
    DELETE  
        It is used to delete the existing records in a table
    SELECT
        it is used to select data from a database and the data returned is stored in a result table,called the result-set.
Commands which can be used with SELECT statement

    DISTINCT
        It is used to return only distinct values .
    ORDER BY 
        It is used to sort the desired result in ascending or descending order.
        By default, the results would be sorted in ascending order.
    Aggregate function
        It works on multiple rows and return single row as output
        COUNT(),MIN(),MAX(),SUM(),AVG()
    GROUP BY 
        It is used with the aggregate functions to group the result-set by one or more columns.
    HAVING clause
        the WHERE clause cannot be used with aggregate functions.
        for that you should use HAVING clause .

PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY

    Foreign key establishes referential integrity between the parent and the child tables.
    The table that has a foreign key is called the child table and
    The table that has a primary key column that is being referenced by the foreign key is called the parent table 

    Department -- Parent Table

        Dept_Id int (PK)
        Dept_Name varchar(50)

    Employee -- Child Table
        Emp_Id int (PK)
        Emp_Name varchar(50)
        Manger_Id int
        Hire_date date 
        Salary int 
        Dept_Id (fk)
    referencial actions 
        No Action 
            It will produce an error indicating that the deletion or updation would create a forign key constraint violation.
        RESTRICT
            It will produce an error indicating that the deletion or updation would create a forign key constraint violation.
        SET NULL 
            when a foreign key is created with ON DELETE SET NULL or ON UPDATE SET NULL , then on delete or on update of data in the parent table, the foreign key column referncing row in the child table will be automatically set to NULL
        SET DEFAULT
            when a foreign key is created with ON DELETE SET DEFAULT or ON UPDATE SET DEFAULT , then on delete or on update of data in the parent table, the foreign key column referncing row in the child table will be automatically set to DEFAULT value if specified any
        CASCADE
             when a foreign key is created with ON DELETE CASCADE or ON UPDATE CASCADE , then on delete or on update of data in the parent table, the foreign key row of referncing row in the child table will be automatically deleted

LIMIT, OFFSET and FETCH
    LIMIT
        It is used to retrieve a portion of the rows out of the complete rows present in the table.
    OFFSET
        It omits the number of rows you mention and then retrieves the rest portion of the rows
    FETCH
        It is used to fetch records from a table using a cursor;
DCL (Data Control Language)
    These commands deal with the permissions, rights and other controls of the database System
        GRANT, REVOKE
    GRANT   
        It is used to provide user access privileges for the schema
    REVOKE
        It is used to withdraw user's access privileges given  by using the GRANT command
TCL (TRansaction Control Language)
    These commands deal with the transaction of the database.
        BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT
BEGIN / BEGIN TRANSACTION / BEGIN transaction_name
    It is used to start the transaction
COMMIT / COMMIT TRANSACTION/ COMMENT transaction_name
    It is used to save all the transactions to the database since the last commit or rollback command
ROLLBACK / ROLLBACK TRANSACTION / ROLLBACK transaction_name / ROLLBACK TO savepoint_name
    It is used to undo transactions since the last commit or rollback command
SAVEPOINT
    It defines a new savepoint within the current transaction
RELEASE SAVEPOINT
    It is used to remove a SAVEPOINT that you have created
